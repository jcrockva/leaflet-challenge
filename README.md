I built an interactive map that displays recent earthquake activity around the world using Leaflet.js for mapping and D3.js to load live earthquake data from the USGS. The map includes multiple background styles that can be toggeled between.

Each earthquake is shown as a circle marker with the size of the marker showing the magnitude. The bigger the marker the larger the magnitude.

The color shows the depth of the quake, using a simple color scale with named colors.

Clicking on a circle shows a popup with key details like location, magnitude, and depth. We also added a legend that explains the color coding, and included tectonic plate boundaries for context.
