Leaflet Challenge

I built an interactive map that displays recent earthquake activity around the world using Leaflet.js for mapping and D3.js to load live earthquake data from the USGS. The map includes multiple background styles that can be toggeled between.

Each earthquake is shown as a circle marker with the size of the marker showing the magnitude. The bigger the marker the larger the magnitude. The color of the circle shows the depth of the earthquake.

Clicking on a circle shows a popup with key details like location, magnitude, and depth. A legend has been included to exlain the color coding. Tectonic plates are also show on as an overlay to show correlation between tectonic plates and earthquakes.
